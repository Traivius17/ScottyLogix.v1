# Welcome to Our Chatbot Application!

This application harnesses the power of a Neural Network model ðŸ§  to assist you.

The model has been trained using a rich dataset comprised of preprocessed JSON intents. These intents encompass various tags, user patterns, and static chatbot responses.

### Understanding the Training Data:
- **Tags (Category):** They provide context and categorization.
- **Patterns (User Text):** Represent diverse user queries or inputs.
- **Responses:** Static but informative responses to cater to user queries.

The data has been meticulously curated, providing specific insights about our company. It's designed to help answer queries from potential employees interested in joining our fleet.

### Trained on the following data:
- Greetings
- Goodbyes
- Age
- Name
- Established
- Driver Pay Rate
- Freight Type
- Home Time Policy
- Company Culture
- Advancement
- Sick And Time Off
- Expectations on ELD
- Safety Record
- Incidents

*Please use inputs that are based around these categories for the best performance*

### *How to locate and use the chatbot*:

Please make use of the menu in the top left corner and select -AI Chatbot-

Type in your question into the text box and press "Enter" 

 Watch ScottyLogix respond below

### Continuous Improvement:
We believe in evolving! More data and potential patterns will continuously enrich the model. This enhancement aims to elevate the user experience, ensuring comprehensive answers to any queries you might have.

Let's embark on this journey together! Feel free to explore and interact with our chatbot.

### Enjoy ðŸ¤–!
